# Within-Subjects Design
> In a within-subjects design, subjects give responses across multiple conditions or across time. In other words, measures are repeated across levels of some condition or across time points. For example, subjects can report how happy they feel when they see a sequence of positive pictures and another sequence of negative pictures. In this case, we'd observe each subjects' happiness in both positive and negative conditions. As another example, we could measure subjects' job satisifcation every month for 3 months. Here we'd observe job satisfaction for each subject across time. In both cases, subject scores across conditions or time very likely correlate with eachother -- they are dependent.

# What are contrasts?
> Broadly, contrasts test focused research hypotheses. A contrast comprises a set of weights or numeric values that represent some comparison. For example, when comparing two experimental group means (i.e., control vs. treatment), you can apply weights to each group mean and then sum them up. This is the same thing as subtracting one group's mean from the other's.

## Here's a quick demonstration

```{r}

# group means
control <- 5
treatment <- 3

# apply contrast weights and sum up the results
sum(c(control, treatment) * c(1, -1))

```

# Model and Conceptual Assumptions for Linear Regression
> * **Correct functional form.** Your model variables share linear relationships.  
> * **No omitted influences.** This one is hard: Your model accounts for all relevant influences on the variables included. All models are wrong, but how wrong is yours?  
> * **Accurate measurement.** Your measurements are valid and reliable. Note that unreliable measures can't be valid, and reliable measures don't necessairly measure just one construct or even your construct.  
> * **Well-behaved residuals.** Residuals (i.e., prediction errors) aren't correlated with predictor variables, predicted values, or eachother, and residuals have constant variance across values of your predictor variables or predicted values.  

# Model and Conceptual Assumptions for Repeated Measures ANOVA
> * **All change scores variances are equal.** Similar to the homogenous group variance assumption in between-subjects ANOVA designs, within-subjects designs require that all change score variances (e.g., subject changes between time points, within-subject differences between conditions) are equal. This means that if you compute the within-subject differences between all pairiwse levels (e.g., timepoints, treatment levels), the variances of those parwises differences must all be equal. For example, if you ask people how satisifed they are with their current job every month for 3 months, then the variance of month 2 - month 1 should equal the variance of month 3 - month 2 and the variance of month 3 - month 1. As you might be thinking, this assumption is very strict and probably not realistic in many cases.

# A different take on the homogenous change score variance assumption
> * **Sphericity and a special case, compound symmetry.** Sphericity is the matrix algebra equivalent to the homogenous change score variance assumption. Compound symmtry is a special case of sphericity. A variance-covariance matrix that satisifies compound symmetry has equal variances (the values in the diagonal) and equal covariances (the values above or below the diagonal).  
> **Short explanation**: Sphericity = homogenous change score variance = compound symmetry

# Here's a simple demonstration using two responses from the same participants

## Load data
> From `help("sleep")`: "Data which show the effect of two soporific drugs (increase in hours of sleep compared to control) on 10 patients."

```{r}

# create label
sleep$group_lbl <- with(sleep, ifelse(group == 1, "drug 1 vs. control", "drug 2 vs. control"))

# "The group variable name may be misleading about the data: They represent measurements on 10 persons, not in groups."
kable(sleep)

```

## Visualize relationships
> It's always a good idea to look at your data. Check some assumptions. 

```{r}

ggplot(sleep, mapping = aes(x = group_lbl, y = extra, color = group_lbl)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = NA, width = 0.25) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.10), alpha = 0.50) +
  theme_bw()

```

## Test within-subjects effect using different approaches

### using `t.test(paired = TRUE)`

```{r}

t.test(extra ~ group, data = sleep, paired = TRUE)

```

### Compute a difference score and test whether the mean difference = 0

```{r}

# using dotproduct
t.test(with(sleep, cbind(extra[group == 1], extra[group == 2]) %*% c(-1, 1)))

# subtracting group 1 from group 2
t.test(with(sleep, extra[group == 1] * -1 + extra[group == 2] * 1))

```

### Fit a linear mixed effects model

```{r}

# create new contrast code called drug, which represents the drug effect on sleep increase
sleep$drug <- with(sleep, ifelse(group == 1, -0.5, 0.5))

# fit model
lmer1 <- lmer(extra ~ drug + (1 | ID), data = sleep, REML = TRUE)

# diagnostics
plot(lmer1)
qqmath(ranef(lmer1, condVar = TRUE))
qqmath(lmer1)
dotplot(ranef(lmer1, condVar = TRUE))

# results
summary(lmer1)

```

# Here's a more complex situation with an additional between-subjects factor

## Generate data

```{r}

# set random seed
set.seed(8888)

# id
id <- 1:50

# two treatment conditions, each size = 25
treatment <- rep(1:2, each = 25)

# labels in a separate column
treatment_lbl <- ifelse(treatment == 1, "control", "treatment")

# draws random numbers from true populations, depending on treatment value
response1 <- rnorm(n = rep(25, 2)[treatment], mean = c(4, 5)[treatment], sd = c(1, 1)[treatment])

# response 2 should be correlated r = 0.5 with response 1, but the mean should be slightly higher
response2 <- response1 * 0.5 + rnorm(n = 50, mean = c(1, 2)[treatment], sd = 1)

# save and print data
mydata <- tibble(id, treatment_lbl, treatment, response1, response2)
kable(mydata)

# restructure
lmydata <- gather(mydata, key = sequence_lbl, value = response, response1:response2) %>% 
  mutate(sequence = ifelse(sequence_lbl == "response1", -0.5, 0.5),
         treatment = ifelse(treatment == 1, -0.5, 0.5))

```

## Visualize relationships
> It's always a good idea to look at your data. Check some assumptions. 

```{r}

ggplot(lmydata, mapping = aes(x = sequence_lbl, y = response, color = treatment_lbl)) +
  geom_violin(position = position_dodge(width = 0.90), alpha = 0) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = NA, width = 0.25, position = position_dodge(width = 0.90)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(dodge.width = 0.90, jitter.width = 0.10), alpha = 0.40) +
  theme_bw()

```

## Test effects using different approaches

### Test average treatment effect (between-subjects)

```{r}

# create new columns that averages the responses
mydata$response_avg <- with(mydata, (response1 + response2) / 2)

# using t.test
t.test(response_avg ~ treatment_lbl, data = mydata)

# using oneway function
oneway(dv = mydata$response_avg, group = mydata$treatment_lbl, contrast = list(treatment_lbl = c(-1, 1)), alpha = 0.05)

# using oneway function and dotproduct
oneway(dv = parse_number(as.matrix(mydata[, c("response1", "response2")]) %*% c(1, 1) / 2), group = mydata$treatment_lbl, contrast = list(treatment_lbl = c(-1, 1)), alpha = 0.05)

```

### Test sequence effect (within-subjects) via multivariate approach
> Average sequence effect will differ depending on whether other terms are included in the model

```{r}

# create new columns that reflects difference between two response
mydata$response_diff <- with(mydata, -response1 + response2)

# using t.test on difference score, compare to mean = 0
with(mydata, t.test(response_diff))

# using paired t.test
t.test(response ~ sequence_lbl, data = lmydata, paired = TRUE)

# using oneway function
oneway(dv = mydata$response_diff, group = mydata$treatment_lbl, contrast = list(treatment_lbl = c(1, 1) / 2), alpha = 0.05)

# using oneway function and dotproduct
oneway(dv = parse_number(as.matrix(mydata[, c("response1", "response2")]) %*% c(-1, 1)), group = mydata$treatment_lbl, contrast = list(treatment_lbl = c(1, 1) / 2), alpha = 0.05)

```

### Test treatment by sequence effect via multivariate approach

```{r}

# using independent samples welch t.test
t.test(response_diff ~ treatment_lbl, data = mydata)

# using oneway function
oneway(dv = mydata$response_diff, group = mydata$treatment_lbl, contrast = list(treatment_lbl = c(-1, 1)), alpha = 0.05)

# using oneway function and dotproduct

```

### Test treatment by sequence effect via linear mixed effects model

```{r}

# fit model
lmer2 <- lmer(response ~ treatment * sequence + (1 + sequence | id), data = lmydata, REML = TRUE, control = lmerControl(check.nobs.vs.nlev = "ignore", check.nobs.vs.nRE = "ignore"))

# Here's an example from the Maxwell, Dalaney, and Kelley (2017) textbook

## Load data
> From `help("C14T8")`: "For the hypothetical data contained in Table 14.8, a perceptual psychologist is interested in age differences ("young" and "old") in reaction time on a perceptual task. In addition, the psychologist is also interested in the effect of angle (zero degrees off center and eight degrees off center). The question of interest is to see if there are is a main effect of age, a main effect of angle, and an interaction between the two. Table 14.8 presents the same data that we analyzed in chapter 12 for 10 young participants and 10 old participants, except that for the moment we are only analyzing data from the 0 degree and 8 degree conditions of the angle factor."
