> I'm a PhD candidate in social psychology working with Josh Ackerman [[**.html**](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/esplab/)] at the University of Michigan. Before I started at Michigan, I received my bachelor's degree in neuroscience from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN. After graduating, I worked as a research assistant and lab manager at the University of Minnesota and the Carlson School of Management.

> Broadly, I use advanced methods and statistics to study how both modern and evolutionarily-relevant threats affect how people perceive themselves and others.
